## Goals

Fast, "modern", dx-forward

- The base is Nushell.
- I can't live without Atuin in the background.

### Workflow essential commands

Nushell replaces a lot of commands, making better rewrites often uneeded, however with that being said:

* curl, wget → [xh](https://github.com/ducaale/xh) - Friendly and fast tool for sending HTTP requests - nushell has its own `http get` as well
* du → [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) - nushell replaces `du` as well
* [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)
* Zoxide
